# However, when working with really large CSV files, you do not want to load the
# entire file into memory first (this is the whole point of this tutorial). An
# alternative strategy is to load the data from the CSV file in chunks (small
# sections) and write them step by step to the SQlite database.
# 
# This can be implemented by reading the CSV file in small sections (letâ€™s say
# 50000 lines each time) and move all sections to a given table in a sqlite
# database. As this is a recurrent task, we will provide the transformation in a
# custom written function, called csv_to_sqlite. The documentation of the
# individual input parameters of the function are explained in the documentation
# section just above the functionn itself. As SQlite does not natively support
# date and datetime representations, the function converts those columns to an
# appropriate string representation before copying the dates to sqlite. To check
# for the date handling, the lubridate package is used.

# v 1: a) exploring read_csv_chunked instead of read_csv
# v 2: a) fn_append_to_sqlite() was throwing error:
# Error in filter_impl(.data, dots) : 
#   SET_VECTOR_ELT() can only be applied to a 'list', not a 'symbol'
# 
# for this line:
#   > x %>%
#   +     filter(row_number() %in% c(1, n()))
# 
# change the code to use slice instead
